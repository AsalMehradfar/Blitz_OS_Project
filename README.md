# Blitz OS Project

This project is my Operating Systems(OS) course project. <br>
The BLITZ System is a collection of software designed to support a university-level course on Operating Systems. In this project, I simulated some aspects of an Operating System in five phases. You can find the original project in the link below: <br>
